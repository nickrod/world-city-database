# world-city-database
This is an easy, automated, and future-proof way to collect and curate worldwide city data. It's very similar to https://github.com/JoshSmith/worldwide-city-database but with the focus on complete set it and forget it automation.

I needed a way to collect worldwide city data so that users on my site can select and set their location. Nothing fancy, just city names, state or region, and country.

Thanks to https://github.com/joshsmith for getting me started, and also this question which provided most of the details, https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/145080/import-geonames-allcountries-txt-into-mysql-5-7-using-load-infile-error-1300
