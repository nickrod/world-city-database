# world-city-database
This is an easy, automated, and future-proof way to collect and curate worldwide city data. It's very similar to https://github.com/JoshSmith/worldwide-city-database but with the focus on complete set it and forget it automation.

I needed a way to collect worldwide city data so that users on my site can select and set their location. Nothing fancy, just city names, state or region, and country.
